# Hackathon Rules

This is CruzHacks' fork of the standard competition rules used at MLH Member Hackathons. Not all MLH Member Hackathons will use these rules as organizers can choose to use these or their own rules. Organizers can use these rules exactly or fork them and edit them to suit their needs.

There are a few documents in the _Hackathon Rules_:

- [Rules](Rules.md): The list of rules participants must follow and the judging criteria.
- [Cheating Response Procedure](Cheating%20Response%20Procedure.md): How people can report violations of the rules and how those reports will be dealt with.
